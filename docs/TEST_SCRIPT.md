## SCRIPT 1: Ulcerative Colitis Follow-Up (~30 seconds)

**[Doctor]** Good morning. How have your symptoms been since we last met?

**[Patient]** Much better. The budesonide really helped. I'm only having two bowel movements a day now, no blood at all.

**[Doctor]** That's great to hear. Any cramping or urgency?

**[Patient]** Just mild cramping occasionally, but the urgency is gone.

**[Doctor]** Excellent. Your labs look good - CRP is down to 3. Let's continue the vedolizumab and taper the budesonide over the next month. I'll see you back in 8 weeks.

## SCRIPT 2: New GERD Patient (~30 seconds)

**[Doctor]** What brings you in today?

**[Patient]** I've been having terrible heartburn for about 3 months now. It's worse at night when I lie down.

**[Doctor]** Any trouble swallowing or weight loss?

**[Patient]** No, just the burning sensation.

**[Doctor]** This sounds like GERD. I'm going to start you on omeprazole 20 milligrams once daily, taken 30 minutes before breakfast. Avoid eating 3 hours before bed. If symptoms don't improve in 4 weeks, we'll schedule an EGD.

## SCRIPT 3: Crohn's Disease Flare (~45 seconds)

**[Doctor]** I see you're here for worsening symptoms. Tell me what's been going on.

**[Patient]** The diarrhea is back - about 5 times a day with some blood. I've also lost about 6 pounds.

**[Doctor]** When did this start?

**[Patient]** About two weeks ago. The pain in my right lower belly is getting worse too.

**[Doctor]** Your fecal calprotectin is elevated at 650. This looks like a Crohn's flare. Since you've been on infliximab for two years, I'm worried about loss of response. Let's check your drug levels and antibodies. We may need to switch to ustekinumab.

**[Patient]** Okay, whatever you think is best.

**[Doctor]** I'll also order an MR enterography to assess your small bowel. Follow up in 2 weeks.
